What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
*I was a little unclear on the difference and relationship between pull, fetch and merge

What concpets were clarified during the GPS?
*some of the command line stuff I'd been having trouble with

What questions did you ask your pair and guide?
*I asked if it was OK that I used this wierd shell setup, and he said it was good as long as it worked but I should look into office hours

What still confuses you about git?
*I have a little trouble with the social functions

How was your first experience pairing?
*I liked it a lot. It was nice being able to bounce ideas off somone and being able to get somone else's input. Took a little of the load off of entering the code having someone to ask for help
