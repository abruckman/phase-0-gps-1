## Release 7: Reflect

** Raul Francisco-Menchavez Reflection ** 

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
> Prior to the GPS session, I was struggling with branching, merging, fetch vs. pull.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
> Pull requests and resolving merge conflicts. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
> How to add collaborators to repository via GitHub.
> How to make edits on merge conflict file. 

What still confuses you about Git?
> Cleaning up / deleting branches.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
> Overall, I thought the GPS was great! Very helpful in the learning process to execute different roles, observe and participate via screen sharing, and have a resource to help guide the session and answer questions.
